# Unsupervised-Energy-Optimization-Analytics
Unsupervised analysis of smart building energy usage using PCA and K-Means for sustainability optimization.
## About the Project
This project focuses on analyzing energy consumption data from smart building systems using unsupervised machine learning techniques.

The main aim is to group buildings based on their energy usage patterns so that inefficient systems can be identified and improved for better sustainability.

Since no predefined efficiency labels are available, clustering methods are used instead of traditional supervised learning models.

## Problem Statement
Smart buildings generate large amounts of energy data, but it is difficult to directly classify them as efficient or inefficient without manual analysis.

The objective of this project is to:
- Analyze energy consumption patterns
- Group similar systems together
- Identify high energy usage and inefficient configurations
- Support energy optimization decisions
